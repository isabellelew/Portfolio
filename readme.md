For this assignment I created a portfolio page. The header includes my name, which also doubles as a home button for the site, as well as a navigation bar with links to the 3 main sections. The first section is a photo and brief introduction, the second section includes links to my work, and the third section is a contact form. When you click each image in the portfolio section, they link to Google. The page ends with a footer. Using media queries, I changed the background color of all elements twice, as the viewport gets smaller.
